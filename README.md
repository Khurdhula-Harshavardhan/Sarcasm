# Sarcasm
The primary objective of our independent study will be to effectively detect sarcasm using both traditional machine-learning approaches and transformer models. 


Our proposed plan includes the following components:

- Testing out the following models:
    - BERT
    - RoBERTa
    - ALBERT
    - DistilBERT
    - ELECTRA
    - GPT
    - XLM
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Ensemble model
    
We plan to also test out a few transformer models not made for classification tasks but can be adapted for classification like GPT, XLM and ELECTRA apart from the usual transformer models used for classification tasks.

- Additionally the agenda is also to perdform analysis and test out the following :

    - Contextual features & Stylistic patterns: Analyzing the surrounding context of a sarcastic statement, such as the presence of specific words, phrases, or patterns that often accompany sarcasm. This includes looking for linguistic cues or stylistic patterns like the use of exaggerated language, irony, puns, or rhetorical questions.

    - Testing pre-trained models and then fine-tuning and training transformer models on our dataset to assess the change in accuracy.

    - Analyzing the role of parent comments in sarcasm detection.

    - Adding sentiment as an additional feature to detect sarcasm.

    - Exploring sarcasm levels and distinctions to develop a deeper understanding of the nuances in sarcasm detection(Tentative - Exploring this topic)
