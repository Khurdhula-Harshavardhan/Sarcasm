I decided to eat at this hot dog place near work for lunch, and when I approached the register I noticed two employees chatting at the end of the counter. They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist.
